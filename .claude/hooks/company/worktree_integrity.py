"""ChainDrop-class defense: verify a freshly created worktree's Claude Code
hook configuration is unmodified before any coding session starts there.

A SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json` auto-executes the instant a
Claude Code session opens in a directory -- before any prompt is sent. The
2026-08-04 "ChainDrop" npm supply-chain worm used exactly this mechanism (a
planted SessionStart command) to harvest tokens from developer machines and
CI runners. `.mcp.json` is the same class of risk: it declares MCP server
launch commands that start automatically, and Forge's worker sessions run
with permission prompts bypassed, so a planted MCP server command would also
auto-execute unreviewed. Forge creates a fresh git worktree per task and
starts a coding session inside it; this module is the gate that must run
immediately after worktree creation and before that session starts.

The anchor is the worktree's OWN HEAD -- `git status --porcelain` scoped to
the guarded paths, run inside the worktree.

An earlier version of this module anchored on the primary checkout's working
tree instead, reasoning that `.claude/settings.json` is human-protected and
therefore a stronger trust anchor than any git ref. That inverts: human-
protected means those files carry permanent *uncommitted* local edits, which
is precisely how this repo is operated. Worktrees are created from `main` and
get the committed content, so the two can never match. Measured 2026-08-15 on
a clean worktree cut from main: `ok=False` with three diverging files, which
would have failed 100% of task executions -- and reported it as a security
violation rather than a configuration mismatch, sending whoever debugged it
hunting for an intrusion.

Anchoring on the worktree's own HEAD is also a tighter fit to the actual
threat. The worktree is created from a reviewed ref seconds earlier; the
attack is something *modifying it after checkout*. That is exactly what
`git status` reports, it cannot false-positive on the primary checkout's
state, and it costs one git call instead of hashing every file under
`.claude/hooks/` on every task.

Untracked files are included (`--untracked-files=all`): planting a NEW file
is at least as likely as editing one. Ignored files are deliberately NOT
included -- `__pycache__` and friends live under `.claude/hooks/` and would
false-positive on every run. A hook file only auto-executes if
`.claude/settings.json` or `.mcp.json` references it, and those are tracked,
so the reference itself gets caught.

`.claude/settings.local.json` is the exception that the git-status check
cannot see and that DOES execute on its own: it is gitignored by design, so
`git status` never reports it at any `-u` level, and Claude Code reads it at
session start like any other settings file. An attack-simulation run on
2026-08-16 caught exactly this -- four planted-file vectors were blocked and
this one sailed through. It is handled by presence instead of by diff: a
worktree is created from a ref seconds earlier and nothing in Forge copies a
local settings file into it, so a `settings.local.json` existing there at all
is anomalous.
